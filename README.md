- Qrack - Qbit OCL Hardware Emulation Stack > https://github.com/vm6502q/qrack
- ProjectQ - QC Interconnect, Qrack OCL fork > https://github.com/vm6502q/ProjectQ
- SimulaQron - Qbit Networking stack > https://github.com/SoftwareQuTech/SimulaQron

Todo:
- Elastic Search/Lucene Interface for data interconnect

Build on top of CUDA-CLuster
- WebVNC, CUDA 9.2+ & OpenCL 1.2+ with NV, AMD & Intel HW support

/me did none of the coding: just created this stack so that you don't need to
